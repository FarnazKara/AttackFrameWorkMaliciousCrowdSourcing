# Crowdsourcing under Data Poisoning Attacks: A Comparative Study
In this project, we propose a comprehensive data poisoning attack taxonomy for truth inference in crowdsourcing and systematically evaluate the state-of-the-art truth inference methods under various data poisoning attacks. We use several evaluation metrics to evaluate and analyze the robustness or susceptibility of different methods against different attacks, which sheds light on the resilience of existing methods and ultimately helps in building more robust truth inference methods in an open setting.
